Explanation:
 * Function Definition:
   * delete_blocks_with_pb3_filter(input_file, output_file): Takes the input and output file paths as arguments.
 * File Handling:
   * Opens both the input and output files in read and write mode, respectively.
 * Block Deletion Logic:
   * in_pb3_block: A boolean variable to track whether the current line is within a block to be deleted.
   * Iterates through each line in the input file:
     * If the line starts with "// view":
       * Checks if "insert_filter: PB3" is present in the line. If so, sets in_pb3_block to True.
       * If in_pb3_block is True, it means we are currently within a block to be deleted.
       * If neither of the above conditions is met, it means we have reached the end of a block to be deleted, so sets in_pb3_block to False.
     * If in_pb3_block is False, write the current line to the output file.
 * Main Execution:
   * Sets the input_filename and output_filename variables to the desired file names.
   * Calls the delete_blocks_with_pb3_filter function with the input and output filenames.
How to Use:
 * Save the code as a Python file (e.g., delete_blocks.py).
 * Replace input.txt and output.txt with the actual file names in the if __name__ == "__main__": block.
 * Run the script from your terminal using python delete_blocks.py.
This will create a new file (output.txt) containing the code without the blocks that include "insert_filter: PB3".
