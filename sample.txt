Here’s a structured comparison of REST API vs GraphQL covering all key features, pros, and cons:

1. Overview

REST API
	•	A widely used architectural style for web services.
	•	Uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
	•	Data is typically exchanged in JSON or XML.

GraphQL
	•	A query language and runtime for APIs, developed by Facebook.
	•	Clients specify exactly what data they need.
	•	Uses a single endpoint for all queries and mutations.

2. Key Features

Feature	REST API	GraphQL
Endpoint Structure	Multiple endpoints for different resources	Single endpoint for all queries/mutations
Data Fetching	Fixed responses per endpoint (over-fetching/under-fetching)	Clients request only needed fields (optimized fetching)
Type System	No strict type system	Strongly typed schema
Batch Requests	Requires multiple calls	Supports batching within a single request
Performance	Can be slow due to multiple round trips	More efficient, but complex queries can be expensive
Caching	Built-in HTTP caching (ETag, 304 Not Modified)	Requires custom caching mechanisms
Real-Time Updates	Uses WebSockets, Server-Sent Events, or polling	Built-in support for real-time subscriptions
Versioning	Versioned APIs (e.g., /v1/users)	No versioning needed; schema evolves over time
Security	Standard authentication (OAuth2, JWT, API keys)	More complex security concerns due to flexible queries
Tooling	Mature ecosystem with Swagger, Postman, etc.	GraphiQL, Apollo, and other GraphQL-specific tools

3. Pros & Cons

REST API

✅ Pros:

✔ Simple, widely adopted, and easy to implement.
✔ Built-in HTTP caching for better performance.
✔ Works well with existing web standards.
✔ Mature security practices and extensive tooling.

❌ Cons:

✖ Over-fetching (receiving more data than needed).
✖ Under-fetching (requiring multiple requests to get related data).
✖ Requires multiple endpoints for different resources.
✖ More difficult to evolve without breaking changes.

GraphQL

✅ Pros:

✔ Flexible queries—fetch only what you need.
✔ Single endpoint simplifies API structure.
✔ Strongly typed schema for better developer experience.
✔ Real-time subscriptions for live updates.

❌ Cons:

✖ Complex queries can impact performance.
✖ No built-in caching like REST (requires custom caching).
✖ More complex security (potential for deep query abuse).
✖ Learning curve for teams new to GraphQL.

4. When to Use REST vs GraphQL

Use Case	REST API	GraphQL
Simple CRUD operations	✅ Yes	❌ No need for GraphQL overhead
Microservices architecture	✅ Yes	❌ REST is better for loosely coupled services
Optimized data fetching	❌ No	✅ Yes
Real-time applications	❌ Requires WebSockets	✅ Built-in subscriptions
Mobile applications	❌ REST may over-fetch data	✅ GraphQL reduces payload size
Strong API versioning needed	✅ REST handles versioning well	❌ No versioning, requires careful schema management

5. Conclusion
	•	Use REST for simpler applications, microservices, and when HTTP caching/versioning is important.
	•	Use GraphQL when you need flexible data fetching, efficient mobile performance, or real-time updates.
	•	Hybrid Approach: Some companies use REST for basic CRUD and GraphQL for complex queries (e.g., GitHub, Shopify).
