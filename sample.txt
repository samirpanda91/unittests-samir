As a software engineer, I aim to implement the following enhancements for the ETL process:
	1.	Migration to a New Repository: Transition the ETL codebase to a new repository that aligns with EPL compliance standards.
	2.	Robust Error Handling: Develop an error-handling mechanism capable of automatically reprocessing failed files and updating the database accordingly.
	3.	Query Failure Management: Introduce error-handling strategies to address and manage failed queries within the ETL workflow.
	4.	Database Enhancements: Apply necessary modifications to the database to support the newly implemented error-handling mechanisms.
	5.	Environment Variable Security: Securely migrate environment variables to HashiCorp Vault for better password management and security.
